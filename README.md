# PoliTrader

PoliTrader is an online trading simulator where instead of trading shares in companies, users can trade shares in politicians. The 'market price' of the politician is based on a sentiment score calculated by performing Twitter sentiment analysis. 

The aim of this project is to provide young adults with an innovative and fun way of keeping up with current events so that they can be informed citizens.
